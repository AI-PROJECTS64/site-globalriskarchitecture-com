    <!-- 1. FROM FRAGMENTED RISK MANAGEMENT TO GLOBAL RISK ARCHITECTURE -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">1. From silos to architecture</div>
      <h2>Why Boards need an integrated architecture of risks</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Over the 2025–2035 horizon, large organisations face overlapping layers of
        risk: climate and nature shocks, energy and commodity constraints,
        geopolitics, macro-financial instability, cyber incidents, model failures,
        supply-chain disruptions. Each of these risks is usually managed in a
        separate silo with its own metrics, taxonomies and dashboards.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        This fragmentation makes it difficult for Boards to answer basic questions:
        <b>Where do our risks actually live?</b> <b>How do they interact?</b>
        <b>Which combinations are potentially systemic for us and for the wider
        system?</b> Regulatory expectations are moving in the same direction,
        calling for <b>holistic, scenario-based views</b> that cut across finance,
        climate, digital and operational resilience.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The idea of a <b>“global risk architecture”</b> responds to this need. It is
        not a new risk type, but a way to look at the <b>structure</b> that holds
        all risks together: layers, connections, decision loops, allocation of
        responsibilities and lines of defence.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. DEFINING GLOBAL RISK ARCHITECTURE -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">2. Definition & scope</div>
      <h2>What is meant by “global risk architecture”?</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        For the purposes of this Concept Note, <b>global risk architecture</b> refers
        to the way an organisation:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Maps</b> its material risks across finance &amp; solvency, climate &amp;
          environment, energy &amp; supply chains, technology &amp; data, and
          geopolitics &amp; systemic shocks.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Connects</b> these risks through taxonomies, dependency maps, common
          data models and cross-risk scenarios.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Prioritises</b> them through appetite, limits, capital and resource
          allocation, both within and across silos.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Governs</b> them via committees, policies, second-line and third-line
          functions, and escalation paths up to the Board.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        In this view, global risk architecture is a <b>meta-framework</b> that sits
        above existing risk types and regulatory regimes. It does not replace Basel,
        Solvency II, IFRS, CSRD, DORA or sectoral rules; instead it offers a
        <b>narrative and structural layer</b> that helps Boards see how all of these
        elements fit together.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The term is deliberately descriptive. It does not prescribe one unique
        methodology or index. Different institutions may define and implement their
        own architectures under the same banner.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. KEY DRIVERS 2025–2035 -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">3. Drivers 2025–2035</div>
      <h2>Forces that make global risk architecture unavoidable</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Several forces combine to make global risk architecture a central concern
        for Boards and supervisors:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Systemic shock accumulation:</b> more frequent climate and nature
          events, water stress, energy volatility, geopolitical tensions, cyber
          incidents and macro-financial shocks, sometimes interacting in non-linear
          ways.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Regulatory convergence:</b> prudential, climate, nature, digital and
          operational-resilience requirements increasingly call for cross-risk
          stress-testing and consolidated narratives on resilience.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Data &amp; model dependency:</b> increased reliance on shared data
          platforms, models, AI and external providers makes the architecture of
          dependencies itself a source of risk.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Stakeholder expectations:</b> investors, supervisors, rating agencies
          and civil society expect clearer explanations of how risk, solvency and
          transition plans fit together at system level.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Systemic actors as “architects”:</b> large reinsurers, systemic banks,
          infrastructure operators and public-private coalitions are naturally
          expected to articulate views on overall risk architecture.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        In this context, a recognised label such as <b>GlobalRiskArchitecture.com
        / .org</b> can serve as a stable anchor for long-term initiatives on these
        questions.

    <!-- 4. COMPONENTS OF A GLOBAL RISK ARCHITECTURE -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">4. Components</div>
      <h2>What a global risk architecture typically includes</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Without prescribing a single blueprint, most global risk architectures will
        touch on a set of recurring components:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Taxonomies &amp; ontologies:</b> consistent naming of risks, drivers,
          channels and impacts across silos, including cross-cutting notions such
          as solvency, resilience and systemic relevance.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Data, models &amp; analytics:</b> shared data lakes, model inventories,
          AI-enabled analytics and stress-testing platforms that underpin views on
          capital, liquidity, climate, nature, cyber and operational risks.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Governance &amp; decision-making:</b> roles of the Board, executive
          committees, risk committees and control functions, including escalation
          paths and accountability for “architecture-level” questions.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>Technology &amp; infrastructure:</b> compute, cloud, networks and
          critical third parties that support risk data, models and reporting,
          including questions of sovereignty and concentration.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          <b>External interfaces:</b> how the organisation explains its risk
          architecture to supervisors, investors, rating agencies, clients and the
          wider public, including disclosures and indices.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        A domain such as <b>GlobalRiskArchitecture.com</b> can act as the public
        entry point where these components are documented and periodically
        updated, while recognising that the detailed implementation remains
        institution-specific.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. POSITIONING OF THE DOMAIN -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">5. Role of the domain</div>
      <h2>How GlobalRiskArchitecture.com / .org can be used</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The domains <b>GlobalRiskArchitecture.com</b> and
        <b>GlobalRiskArchitecture.org</b> are proposed as <b>neutral semantic
        surfaces</b> that an acquirer may use to:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          Brand a <b>“Global Risk Architecture Programme”</b> mandated by the
          Board, consolidating existing risk frameworks under one umbrella.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Host a <b>Global Risk Architecture Observatory or Index</b> tracking how
          sectors and jurisdictions structure their risk architectures and
          resilience levels.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Provide a <b>reference URL</b> for principles, handbooks and dashboards
          explaining the organisation’s architecture of risks to supervisors and
          investors.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          Anchor public-private initiatives, councils or taskforces exploring
          architecture-level questions at system scale.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        The .com surface is naturally suited for <b>corporate and investor-facing
        narratives</b>, while the .org surface can be used for
        <b>institutional, research or coalition-oriented activities</b>, should the
        acquirer choose to open parts of its framework.
